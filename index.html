  <h4>What emotions/feelings does this performance invoke? What is your initial reaction?</h4>
  <p>My initial reaction was joy. I felt happy because you could hear the singers very clearly, and they were in sync. Even when the lower part got quieter, you could still hear them clearly.</p>
  <!-- section 1a, 3 and 4 -->
  <h4>What do you think the purpose of this song is?</h4>
  <p>I think the purpose of this song was for entertainment. I know Inuit singers perform throat singing as a form of entertainment and contest, to see who can outlast the other.</p>
  <h4>In what setting do you think the song would be performed?</h4>
  <p>I think this is a song that would be performed in a friend/family gathering. I think this because throat singing traditionally is less of a music genre, and more of a game.</p>
  <!-- section 1a, 5 -->
  <h4>Where (geographically)  do you think this music is from and what made you think it was from this area?</h4>
  <p>I think this music is from Canada. I know this because there are two people singing, which is how Inuit throat singing is performed.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The melody is performed by one voice the entire time. The melodic singer is singing less gutturally than the lower singer, but still using a throat singing voice. I think the melody is in a major key.</td>
      <td>There are multiple pitches moving together, there’s a low pitch and a high pitch. They’re in harmony because the lower pitch acts as a percussion track for the higher pitch singer.</td>
      <td>I hear two sounds. The sound is very thick with the lower singer, while the higher singer has a more medium texture.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Both singers have a very warm sound. The lower singer has a more warm and heavy tone, I think this is because they’re singing very gutturally from their throat, which produces a low warm sound. The higher singer is less guttural and is more melodic.</td>
        <td>The piece changes dynamics a lot. The volume in the singers fluctuate as the lower singer gets louder and the high singer gets quieter. I think it’s mostly mezzo-forte.</td>
        <td>This piece is fairly fast, probably around allegro. The piece gets faster about halfway through.</td>
