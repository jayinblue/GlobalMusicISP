  <h4>What emotions/feelings does this performance invoke? What is your initial reaction?</h4>
  <p>My initial reaction was joy. I felt happy because you could hear the singers very clearly, and they were in sync. Even when the lower part got quieter, you could still hear them clearly.</p>
  <!-- section 1a, 3 and 4 -->
  <h4>What do you think the purpose of this song is?</h4>
  <p>I think the purpose of this song was for entertainment. I know Inuit singers perform throat singing as a form of entertainment and contest, to see who can outlast the other.</p>
  <h4>In what setting do you think the song would be performed?</h4>
  <p>I think this is a song that would be performed in a friend/family gathering. I think this because throat singing traditionally is less of a music genre, and more of a game.</p>
  <!-- section 1a, 5 -->
  <h4>Where (geographically)  do you think this music is from and what made you think it was from this area?</h4>
  <p>I think this music is from Canada. I know this because there are two people singing, which is how Inuit throat singing is performed.</p>
