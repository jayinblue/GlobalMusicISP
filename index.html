  <h4>What emotions/feelings does this performance invoke? What is your<br> initial reaction?</h4>
  <p>My initial reaction was joy. I felt happy because you could hear the singers<br> very clearly, and they were in sync. Even when the lower part got quieter,<br> you could still hear them clearly.</p>
