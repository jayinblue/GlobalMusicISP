    <h1>About this page</h1>
    <p>This website was created for a school project. I made it entirely from scratch in replit, an online IDE. You can check out the code at <a href='https://github.com/jayinblue/GlobalMusicISP'> Github.</href></a> I made this project entirely open-source, so feel free to go through my code and make fun of me! :)</p>
